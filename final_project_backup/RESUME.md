It uses a standard Python structure so it works in VS Code, PyCharm, or here.

## 📝 Next Steps for Next Session
When you come back, paste this into the chat to remind me:

> "We finished building the 'Digital Business Investor' MVP. The code is in `uk_smb_investor`. We need to:
> 1. Run user tests with 10 businesses.
> 2. Collect feedback on the 'Triage -> Interrogation' flow.
> 3. Refine the questions based on what confuses people."
